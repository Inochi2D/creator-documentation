Inochi Creator is an open source editor for the `Inochi2D puppet format <https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d>`_.
This application allows you to rig models for use in games or for other real-time applications such as `VTubing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber>`_.
Animation is achieved by morphing, transforming and in other ways distorting layered 2D textures in real-time.
These distortions can trick the end user in to perciving 3D depth in the 2D art.

If you are a VTuber wanting to use Inochi2D we highly recommend checking out `Inochi Session <https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi-session>`_ as well.

To get started check out our `Getting Started Guide <./getting-started.html>`_
