About Inochi2D
==============

| Inochi2D is a library for realtime 2D puppet animation and the reference implementation of the Inochi2D Puppet standard. 
| It works by deforming 2D meshes created from layered art at runtime based on parameters, this deformation tricks the viewer in to seeing 3D depth and movement in the 2D art.
|
| The Inochi2D Project provides official tools for manipulating and using these models for VTubing, via :doc:`Inochi Creator </creator/about>` and :doc:`Inochi Session </session/index>`.
| 
| The Inochi2D section covers the specification for implementing your own instance of Inochi2D, if you wish to know more about the API of the Inochi2D D package, see the `dpldocs page <https://inochi2d.dpldocs.info/v0.7.2/inochi2d.html>`__.
