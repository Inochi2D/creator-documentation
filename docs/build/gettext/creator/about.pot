msgid "Inochi Creator is an open source editor for the `Inochi2D puppet format <https://github.com/Inochi2D/inochi2d>`_. This application allows you to rig models for use in games or for other real-time applications such as `VTubing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber>`_. Animation is achieved by morphing, transforming and in other ways distorting layered 2D textures in real-time. These distortions can trick the end user in to perciving 3D depth in the 2D art."
