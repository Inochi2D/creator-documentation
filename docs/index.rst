What is Inochi2D?
-----------------

Inochi2D is an open source specification for a 2D character animation system that allows characters to be animated in real-time for games and VTubing. Inochi2D achieves this by deforming textures in real time based on parameters the rigger sets in Inochi Creator.

This documentation page covers:
  - Inochi Creator
  - Inochi Session
  - Inochi2D Specification for implementers
  - Inochi2D SDK for developers

**Inochi Creator** is the official tooling to create animated rigs for use with Inochi2D compliant software and games.

**Inochi Session** is the official tooling to use Inochi2D models for VTubing, using various forms of body and face tracking.

**Inochi2D Specification** is meant for developers that want to implement Inochi2D in their preferred engine.

**Inochi2D SDK** is the official Software Development Kit that allows integrating Inochi2D in to your games and software.
